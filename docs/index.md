## Get API Access

To develop themes with Theme Kit, you will need to authorize Theme Kit to access your store.
Head to `https://[your-store-name].myshopify.com/admin/apps/private` it should look something
like this:

<img src="{{ "/assets/images/private-apps.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />

Click on the `Create private apps` button. You will see this screen:

<img src="{{ "/assets/images/create-private-app.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />

Fill out the information at the top and set the permissions of `Theme templates and theme assets` to
read and write access. Press `Save` and you will be presented with the next screen. In it you will
see your access credentials. Please make note of the password. You will need it later.

<img src="{{ "/assets/images/private-app-password.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />

## Use a new theme.

If you are starting from scratch and want to get a quick start, run the following:

```bash
theme bootstrap --password=[your-password] --store=[your-store.myshopify.com]
```

This will create a new theme for your online store from the [Timber](https://shopify.github.io/Timber/) template. Then
it will download all those assets from Shopify and automatically create a `config.yml` file for you.

## Configure an existing theme.

If you already have a theme on Shopify and want to start using it you will need to
view it in your browser and grab the theme ID from the URL. It should look like the
following:

<img src="{{ "/assets/images/theme-id.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />

Then once you have noted your theme ID, run the following commands:

```bash
# create configuration
theme configure --password=[your-password] --store=[you-store.myshopify.com] --themeid=[your-theme-id]
# download and setup project in the current directory
theme download
```
