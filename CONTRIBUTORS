# Pre-Requisites

In order to work on this project **you'll need to have godep installed** on your system. This can easily
be done by running the following command:

  go get github.com/tools/godep

Please see the [godep documentation](https://github.com/tools/godep) for more details.

# Getting the Source Code

You can easily obtain the source code and all dependencies by typing the following into a console:

  go get -u github.com/csaunders/themekit

Switch to that directory and run the Makefile. This will create a `build/development` directory which will
contain the program. The Makefile will use `godep` to ensure that the builds are reliable for your system.
