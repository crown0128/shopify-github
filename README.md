# Development

Themekit requires go 1.8. You can setup your development environment by running
the following:

```bash
go get -u github.com/Shopify/themekit
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/Shopify/themekit
make [mac_tools|linux_tools] # install platform specific development tools
glide install # see https://github.com/Masterminds/glide for glide usage
make # build themekit
theme version #should output the current themekit version
```

This will install theme kit into `$GOPATH/bin` and you will now have access to
the theme command.
